app working
thoughts:
- workflow still has to be much better, much smaller todo's
- almost everything is now super dirty, version 02 will have no additional features, looking exactly like version 01, but with cleaner code:
	- form validation (security in general? think about it 5mins)
	- action handling is now pretty much hardcoded, should be much more flexible
	- oop not really used at all
	- DB usage not implemented cleanly
	- template pattern not implemented well. using global =(
